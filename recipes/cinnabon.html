    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, warm the milk and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, melted butter, salt, eggs, and flour to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place it in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle (about 16x12 inches).</li>
        <li>Spread the softened butter over the dough. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together, then sprinkle it evenly over the buttered dough.</li>
        <li>Starting from the long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Cut it into 12 equal pieces and place them in a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cover and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the frosting by mixing together powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and milk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the rolls are done baking, spread the frosting over them while they are still warm.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade Cinnabon cinnamon rolls!</li>
